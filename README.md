# PRODIGY_CS_02
Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption platform used: python(IDLE) Creating a basic image encryption tool using pixel manipulation can be a fun project! We can use Python and libraries like PIL (Python Imaging Library) to handle the image processing. My code performs a simple XOR encryption/decryption operation on each pixel of the image. You can modify the encryption and decryption functions to implement more complex algorithms if needed. Make sure to install PIL using pip install Pillow if you haven't already.
